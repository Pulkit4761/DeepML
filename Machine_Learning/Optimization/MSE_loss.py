'''
In this problem, you need to implement a single function that can perform three
variants of gradient descent Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Batch Gradient Descent,
and Mini Batch Gradient Descent using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
The function will take an additional parameter to specify which variant to use.
 Note: Do not shuffle the data
